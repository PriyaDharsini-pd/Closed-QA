This close asso- ciation of one melanocyte to 36 viable keratino- cytes was quite a remarkable observation and indicated a close and mutual relationship – akin perhaps, to the relationship between neuron and glial cell. Similarly, it is likely that hair bulb mela- nocytes of the follicular melanin unit also inﬂu- ence their pre-cortical keratinocyte neighbours in several ways (and vice versa) [19, 24, 84]. For example, melanin transfer to keratinocytes appears to reduce the latter’s proliferative potential and rather may stimulate their terminal differentiation. This melanin-associated ‘brake’ on keratinocyte proliferation or its modulation of keratinocyte differentiation appears to be lifted somewhat in greying or white hair follicles. Indeed, white beard hair appears to grow faster than do adjacent pigmented hair in vivo [88].

Despite their shared origins in the embryologic neural crest, the hair follicle and epidermal distinct, although open, cutaneous compartments. They can be distinguished principally on the basis of the former’s stringent coupling to the hair growth cycle compared with the latter’s continuous mela- nogenesis. The biosynthesis of melanin and its subsequent transfer from melanocyte to hair bulb keratinocytes depend on the availability of melanin precursors and on a raft of signal transduction pathways that are both highly complex and com- monly redundant. These signalling pathways can be both dependent and independent of receptors, act through auto-, para- or intracrine mechanisms and can be modiﬁed by hormonal signals. Despite many follicular melanocytes appear to be more sensitive than epidermal mela- nocytes to ageing inﬂuences.

Greying hair is often coarser, wirier and more unmanageable compared with pigmented hair, which would again reﬂect a change in the chemi- cal and physical properties of the post-pigmented hair ﬁbre [29]. Additionally, grey hair is often unable to hold a set and is more resistant to incor- porating artiﬁcial colour.

Hair colour is determined by cells called melano- cytes, which produce different combinations of light-absorbing melanin pigments2. Melano- cytes are derived from melanocyte stem cells (MeSCs), which are located in a part of the hair follicle called the bulge3. The normal hair cycle is divided into three stages: hair-follicle regen- eration (anagen), degeneration (catagen) and rest (telogen). Melanocyte production begins early in the anagen phase (Fig. 1a). As people age, the pool of MeSCs is gradually depleted — and so pigmented hair becomes ‘salt and pepper’ coloured, and then turns to grey and finally to white after a complete loss of pigment in all hair follicles4.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data/Nature_how stress causes premature grey (1).pdf'}),\n",

Melanocyte stem cells (MeSCs) are located in the bulge of the hair follicle, which is innervated by neurons of the sympathetic nervous system that release the neurotransmitter molecule noradrenaline. The follicle cycles through three phases: regeneration (anagen), degeneration (catagen) and rest (telogen). a, Under normal conditions, MeSCs migrate away from the bulge (red arrows) and differentiate into melanocytes during anagen. Melanocytes synthesize pigments that add colour to the regenerating hair. During catagen and telogen, they begin to die and migrate out of the niche (not shown). However, plentiful MeSCs remain to replace the melanocytes in the next anagen phase. b, Zhang et al.1 show that stressful stimuli activate the sympathetic nervous system, increasing noradrenaline release in hair follicles.

Together, these results indicate that noradrenaline released from active sympathetic neurons triggers MeSC depletion (Fig. 1b).

              " Document(page_content='Exactly how does sympathetic activity cause depletion of MeSCs from hair follicles? Normally, these stem cells are maintained in a dormant state until hair regrowth is required. However, when the researchers tracked MeSCs labelled with a fluorescent protein, they discovered that MeSC prolifer- ation and differentiation increase markedly under extreme stress or exposure to a high level of noradrenaline. This results in mass migration of melano cytes away from the bulge, and leaves no remaining stem cells. To further confirm this result, the researchers suppressed MeSC proliferation pharmaco- logically and genetically. When proliferation was dampened, the effects of stress on MeSC proliferation, differentiation and migration were blocked.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data/Nature_how stress causes premature grey (1).pdf'}),\n",

For instance, is the mechanism underlying MeSC depletion in response to stress the same as that which causes greying during ageing? Future experiments modulat- ing SNS activity over a longer period would determine whether age-related greying can be\\n\\nslowed or hastened. Perhaps, in the absence of sympathetic signals, MeSCs have the capacity for unlimited replenishment, pointing to a way to delay age-related greying.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data/Nature_how stress causes premature grey (1).pdf'}),\n",

In support of this idea, haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which give rise to blood and immune lineages, reside in a bone-marrow niche that contains stromal cells, and stimulation of those cells by the SNS causes HSPCs to leave their niche11,12. Perhaps, like MeSCs, stress depletes HSPCs — which could partially explain why immune function is impaired in response to chronic stress13,14. Whether this type of relationship extends beyond MeSCs and HSPCs is an open question. It is fascinating to consider what possible evolutionary advantage might be conferred by stress-induced greying. Because grey hair is most often linked to age, it could be associ- ated with experience, leadership and trust15.

Independent of age and gender, this condition exerts a profound negative impact on some people’s quality of life [4] and, especially when occurring at an early age, it is frequently associated to depression [5,6]. During PHL, HFs undergo a premature miniaturization and shorten their permanence in anagen. The etiology of PHL is complex and involves a combination of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors [7,8]. Only for Androgenic Alopecia, one of the most common cause of PHL, pathogenesis has been partially elucidated and proven to involve an altered metabolism of testosterone [6]. The increased activity of the type II isoform of the 5-α reductase enzyme (5AR) and the local level of its product dihydrotestosterone, results in shortening of anagen phase and progressive miniaturization of the HFs [9].', metadata={'source': '/content/Data/Annurca Apple Polyphenols Ignite Keratin Production in Hair Follicles (1).pdf'}),\n",

In support of the ﬁrst hypothesis, a progressive mitochondrial hyper-polarization has been recently shown in early anagen HF cells. This mitochondrial activity seems to increase in differentiating HF cells and to abruptly reduce when differentiation is complete [46,55,61,62]. However, in support of the second hypothesis, polyphenol have been in many contexts shown to directly affect mitochondrial activity and stimulate mitochondrial ATP production. Both epicatechin and Procyanidin B2 possess uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation in cardiac mitochondria [63], suppressing activity of pyruvate and malate oxidation and stimulating fatty acid β-oxidation.

In the process of becoming HM cells hair stem cell engages in aerobic glycolysis, lactate production [55] and PPP to sustain the high rate of proliferation they are subjected to.

Neuronal activities control their pigment-producing cells (chromatophores), allowing rapid changes in colour in response to predators or threats44. Therefore, an attractive hypothesis is that sympathetic nerves might modulate MeSC activity, melanocyte migration or pigment production in situations independent of the hair cycle—for example, under bright sunlight or UV irradiation45.

It has great social and psychological relevance and the possibility of controlling it has immense resonance for any individual or ethnic group. The colour of human hair, skin, and eyes is determined by the amount, type, and tissue distribution of melanin. Melanin is a complex mixture of pigmented indole-rich biopolymers that are synthesised by specialised cells called melanocytes. The main types of melanin polymer are the black-to-brown eumela- nin (highly polymerised) and the yellow- to-reddish-brown pheomelanin (lighter, less polymerised, and containing sulfur) [1]. Black hair has the highest eumelanin- to-pheomelanin ratio while red-to-yellow hairs have the lowest ratio; grey or white hairs have insigniﬁcant or no melanin at all.

The loss of pigment from the scalp HFs is therefore a direct consequence the shutdown of melanin synthesis, of as conﬁrmed by comparative transcrip- tome analysis between grey and pig- mented HFs (Box 1). This shutdown can have several causes acting at different levels and HF locations [6,7], coordinately or independently: (i) cessation of melanin production; (ii) apoptosis of follicular differ- entiated melanocytes; and (iii) incapacity to maintain the homeostasis of the mela- nocyte stem cell niche.\\n\\nThe key observation common to all of these processes is oxidative damage.

Obviously, it would be preferable if hair-greying reversal could occur immediately after the applica- tion of a formulation, regardless of the hair cycle stage. The migration of melanocytes in an already formed follicle would not be as easy but is possible, since these cells are capable of movement as seen in vitro and in vitiligo treatment.

Hairs were depilated to induce hair regeneration when their hair cycle reached telogen. Mice were stressed and depilated four rounds in total to monitor long-term changes. For chronic unpredictable stress, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to a combination of stressors. Two of the stressors were applied each day.
